## Description

CityBookWings provides flight information for any city you'd like to travel to, and recommends books about that city that you might like to read.

### Features:
* Uses three APIs (open Library, Exchange Rate and Booking.com Flights API) to allow users to:
	* Search for flights, and see a range of results sorted from lowest cost, ascending;
	* See prices in GBP;
	* Get book recommendations related to their flight destination.
* Uses the Bootstrap 5.3.2 framework for a polished and responsive design.
* Uses custom CSS and JavaScript for animations and search functionality.
* Uses localStorage to save the user's previous search results in their browser.
